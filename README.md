Here you will find information about all of my projects and links to the code behind it.

<a href="http://rowanlangford.com/how-to-improve-college-graduation-rates/">How to Improve College Graduation Rates</a>: My capstone project focused on determining the factors that influence whether or not a student will graduate from college. I used five different machine learning techniques and included a non-technical write-up for the project.

<a href="http://rowanlangford.com/web-scraping-indeed-com/">Web Scraping Indeed.com</a>: This project focused on my web scraping skills to determine if a job on Indeed.com was above or below the median salary based on natural language processing tactics.

<a href="http://rowanlangford.com/bayesian-terror-analysis/">Bayesian Terror Analysis</a>: This project focused on using Bayesian analysis to look at differences between terror groups from the Global Terrorism Database maintained by START (University of Maryland).

I am always working on something new and would love to hear from you about my projects or any job opportunities.
